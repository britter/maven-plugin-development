# Maven Plugin Development Gradle plugin - Changelog

## Version 1.0

This release marks the move of this plugin to the [GradleX project](https://github.com/gradlex-org).
Consequently this is a breaking release with features being dropped, plugin ID and code coordinate changes, and the implementation language changing from Kotlin to Java.
The minimal required Gradle version has been increased to 7.0.
Lower versions of Gradle might be supported but are not tested.

* [Fixed] [#57](https://github.com/britter/maven-plugin-development/issues/57) Remove javaClassesDir from GenerateMavenPluginDescriptorTask.
* [Fixed] [#210](https://github.com/britter/maven-plugin-development/issues/210) Drop feature: Mojo source set. It's not longer possibel to define a dedicated source set for defining the mojo. Use a dedicated project instead.

## Version 0.3.0

*Note:* This release includes a change in behavior of the HelpMojo generation.
Before 0.3.0 generation of a HelpMojo could be turned on by setting `generateHelpMojo` to `true`.
Starting with 0.3.0 `generateHelpMojo` is deprecated and replaced by `helpMojoPackage`.
Users now need to define the package of the HelpMojo.
This fixes problems with up-to-date checking (see [#16](https://github.com/britter/maven-plugin-development/issues/16)).

* [Fixed] [#34](https://github.com/britter/maven-plugin-development/issues/34) Task descriptions for help and descriptor task are swapped
* [Fixed] [#16](https://github.com/britter/maven-plugin-development/issues/16) Help mojo task is never up to date because descriptor tasks modifies outputs
