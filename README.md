This plugin aims to fill the tiny gap for people who need to create an [Apache Maven](https://maven.apacke.org) plugin from a Gradle build.
To do this the plugin wraps around the [Maven Plugin Tools API](https://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/) and feeds it with the right inputs from the Gradle build.

Compatible with Gradle 5.5.1 or later.

## Features

- Automatic generation of a maven plugin descriptor containing all mojos in the selected source set (by default the plugin looks for mojo implementations in the main source set)
- Support for annotation and JavaDoc tag based mojo implementations
- Optional generation of a help mojo implementation

## Usage
